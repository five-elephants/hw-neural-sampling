Hardware implementation of Neural Sampling
==========================================

This is a simple VHDL implementation of neural sampling. It is not really a
usable system at this point, but demonstrates correct sampling.  I put it here
in case it is useful for someone or I want to go back to it at some point.


Usage
-----

You need ghdl installed. Then you can

  $ make sampling

to run sampling or

  $ make test_activation

to test the implemented activation function.

Use the provided IPython notebooks for evaluation of results.
